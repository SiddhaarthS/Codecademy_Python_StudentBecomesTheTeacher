# Codecademy_Python_StudentBecomesTheTeacher
This is my work for my Codecademy course on Python :) Welcome to this "Challenge Course". Until now we've been leading you by the hand and working on some short and relatively easy projects. This is a challenge so be ready. We have faith in you!  Weâ€™re going to switch it up a bit and allow you to be the teacher of your own class. Make a gradebook for all of your students.
